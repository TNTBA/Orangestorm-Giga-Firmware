 I, Mathias Panzenböck, place this file hereby into the public domain. Use it at your own risk for whatever you like.
 In case there are jurisdictions that don't support putting things in the public domain you can also consider it to
 be "dual licensed" under the BSD, MIT and Apache licenses, if you want to. This code is trivial anyway. Consider it
 an example on how to get the endian conversion functions on different platforms.
