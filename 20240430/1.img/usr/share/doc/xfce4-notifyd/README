Xfce Notify Daemon
==================

The Xfce Notify Daemon (or "xfce4-notifyd") is a small program that implements
the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications
specification. Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in a
standard way can implicitly make use of xfce4-notifyd to do so by sending
standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications
interface.

Apart from the notification server a panel plugin is included which shows recent
notifications in a dropdown menu in the Xfce Panel.


Requirements:
-------------

* gtk+ 3.14.0
* glib-2.0 (gdbus) 2.42
* libxfce4util 4.12.0
* libxfce4ui 4.12.0
* xfconf 4.10
* libnotify 0.7
* libxfce4panel 4.12.0 (for the panel plugin)

Additionally, having a compositing manager running is recommended. This is
necessary for features like transparency and animations.


Installation:
-------------

The usual:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

should work just fine.  Pass --prefix=/path/to/wherever to install in a
location other than the default /usr/local.

In order for xfce4-notifyd to be started automatically, you must have a
<servicedir> directive in your D-Bus session configuration file.  If you
install xfce4-notifyd to a standard prefix (like /usr), you shouldn't have
to worry about this.


Configuration:
--------------

Run xfce4-notifyd-config to display the settings dialog. There are no hidden
settings, which means if you don't see it in the settings dialog, it's not
changeable.

The panel plugin has a separate properties dialog, which shows all configuration
options for it.


Theming:
--------

Xfce4-notifyd uses Gtk+'s standard theming system. By default it will use the
"app-notification" or "osd" classes of your Gtk+ theme. If you want to override
the default notifications style of your theme you can use the
"#XfceNotifyWindow" widget name or you can create a standalone theme (see the
examples included, e.g. "ZOMG-PONIES!").
You have to put your gtk.css file in $HOME/.themes/THEMENAME/xfce4-notify-4.0
and then start up the configuration dialog to set the theme.

If you have created a cool theme you can submit it via a bugreport on
bugs.xfce.org. For themes shipped with xfce4-notifyd, all parts are required to
be redistributable under the terms of a license compatible with GPLv2.
